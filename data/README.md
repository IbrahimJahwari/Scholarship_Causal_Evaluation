This folder contains the simulated dataset and supporting files used for the analysis of the scholarship programâ€™s impact. The data here are required to reproduce all results in the report.

## Contents

simulated.csv: This is the main student-level dataset used in the analysis. It includes demographic variables (e.g., gender, region), subject area, treatment status, composite scores, academic outcomes (GPA, university attended), and university ranking information.

rankings.csv: A reference table of global university rankings from QS (2025). Contains both overall and subject-specific ranks for a set of universities. This file is used when assigning universities to simulated students in the data generation process.

## Data Generation

The dataset is simulated using the dataset_simulation.R script found in the code/ folder. This script produces realistic student profiles based on plausible regional weights, subject distributions, and treatment assignment rules based on composite scores and interview selection.

Key features of the simulation process:
1. Composite scores are generated from simulated test and behavioral metrics using PCA.
2. Only the top 40% of students (by composite score) are eligible for treatment; from this group, 200 are randomly selected to receive the scholarship.
3. GPA and university placement are generated based on treatment status and a region-specific disadvantage index.
4. University assignment is probabilistic, drawing from a pool of ranked institutions with weights favoring stronger placements for treated students.
5. The final dataset merges student records with university ranking data and computes both subject-specific and overall university rank metrics.
6. The simulated dataset preserves the structure and logic of the real-world project that inspired this analysis, but contains no real student data.

## How to Regenerate

To regenerate the simulated.csv file from scratch:

1. Ensure rankings.csv is available in the same data/ folder.
2. Run code/dataset_simulation.R.
3. The script will produce and overwrite data/simulated.csv.
